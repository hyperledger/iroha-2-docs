From time to time, you may have questions about Iroha that you would like to discuss in detail with others. There are three ways to quickly get in touch with our community: Telegram, Discord, and GitHub.

A large part of the community currently uses [Telegram](https://t.me/hyperledgeriroha) for communication. The Hyperledger part of the team prefers [Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperledger), with two dedicated channels: `iroha` and `iroha-2-contributors`. The Discord and Telegram channels are synchronized, so users of both media see your messages.

Finally, you can [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/new/choose), whether it's a request to update documentation, a suggestion for the core team, or a bug you have found.
