# Code Snippets

To make code snippets in the documentation more "real" and robust, it is
better to fetch them directly from the source files. The sources are
located in other repositories, where they are built, run, and tested.

## How it works

### Snippet Sources

Snippet sources are defined in
[`snippet_sources.ts`](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/blob/main/etc/snippet_sources.ts).
The `snippet_sources.ts` file is located at the documentation repository
and has the following format:

```ts
export default [
  {
    src: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/iroha/iroha2-stable/MAINTAINERS.md',
    filename: 'iroha-maintainers-at-stable.md',
  },
  {
    src: './src/example_code/lorem.rs',
  },
]
```

- `src` defines the source file location and could be either an HTTP(s) URI
  or a relative file path.
- `filename` (optional) explicitly defines the local filename.

### Fetching Snippets

Code snippets are fetched from the locations specified in
`snippet_sources.ts` and written into the `/src/snippets` directory. There
are two ways to fetch the snippets:

- Automatically after dependencies were installed (i.e. `pnpm install`)
- Manually by calling `pnpm get-snippets`

::: tip

By default, snippets are deleted and reloaded each time `pnpm get-snippets`
is called. For local development it might be more convenient to enable
"lazy" behavior by calling `pnpm get-snippets --force false`.

### Using Snippets in Markdown

Use
[Code Snippets feature in VitePress](https://vitepress.vuejs.org/guide/markdown#import-code-snippets)
to include snippets into documentation:

**Input**

```md
<<<@/snippets/lorem.rs

<<<@/snippets/lorem.rs#ipsum
```

**Output**

<<<@/snippets/lorem.rs

<<<@/snippets/lorem.rs#ipsum

Note that we included only the `#ipsum` code region, not the entire file.
This feature is essential when it comes to including code from real source
files into the documentation.

## Example

Let's add a code snippet from Iroha JavaScript SDK. For example, this one:
[`/packages/docs-recipes/src/1.client-install.ts`](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/blob/e300886e76c777776efad1e2f5cb245bfb8ed02e/packages/docs-recipes/src/1.client-install.ts).

1. First, get a permalink to the file. Open the file on GitHub and click
   `Raw` button to get the link. For example:
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/e300886e76c777776efad1e2f5cb245bfb8ed02e/packages/docs-recipes/src/1.client-install.ts

2. Define the new snippet in the [Snippet Sources](#snippet-sources):

   ```ts
   export default [
     /// ...

     {
       src: 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/iroha-javascript/e300886e76c777776efad1e2f5cb245bfb8ed02e/packages/docs-recipes/src/1.client-install.ts',
       filename: 'js-sdk-1-client-install.ts',
     },
   ]
   ```

   ::: tip

   Since `snippet_sources.ts` is a TypeScript file, we can use all
   scripting features in it. Meanwhile, we are trying to keep it as simple
   as possible, so even the one who doesn't know TypeScript at all could
   edit it.

   However, we use _a bit_ of scripting. We defined several constants with
   git revisions from multiple repositories:

   ```ts
   const IROHA_REV_STABLE = 'c4af68c4f7959b154eb5380aa93c894e2e63fe4e'

   const IROHA_REV_DEV = '...'

   const IROHA_JS_REV = '...'
   ```

   Then we use them in links to snippet sources in place of git revisions,
   like this:

   ```ts
   export default [
     // ...

     {
       src: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hyperledger/iroha/${IROHA_REV_STABLE}/MAINTAINERS.md`,
       //                                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       filename: 'iroha-maintainers-at-stable.md',
     },
   ]
   ```

   It helps us to reduce repetitions and keep sources clean.

3. [Include](#using-snippets-in-markdown) the snippet in any Markdown file
   in the documentation as follows:

   **Input**

   ```md
   <<<@/snippets/js-sdk-1-client-install.ts
   ```

   **Output**

   <<<@/snippets/js-sdk-1-client-install.ts
