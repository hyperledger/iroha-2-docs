# Iroha 2 vs. Iroha 1

Iroha 2 is a **complete** re-write of Hyperledger Iroha in Rust. As of
writing, the two projects are developed concurrently.

In this introduction we outline the differences between the two versions of
Iroha and highlight the new features of Iroha 2. It should be of particular
interest to those who are already familiar with Iroha but wish to upgrade
and start using the newer version.

::: info

Note that Iroha 1 and Iroha 2 are not compatible. Both projects are very
different in their approaches and implementations as we present in the
comparison below.

Among other changes, cryptography and account structures are implemented
differently, meaning that users would have to generate new keys and link to
their old account through a centralized service and no data from Iroha 1
would be accessible from Iroha 2.

## Fault Tolerance

Iroha 2 learned a great deal from the development of the original Iroha. Of
particular importance is the new and improved Byzantine-fault-tolerant
consensus algorithm: _Sumeragi_. This new consensus allowed us to expand
what could be done on a blockchain without any security risks.

::: info

The first version of Iroha used a consensus algorithm called _Yac_. _Yac_
is _crash-fault-tolerant_, which means that it can survive a set number of
nodes _crashing_: i.e. losing power, being cut off from the network, or
being destroyed with a sledgehammer.

_Sumeragi_, by contrast, was designed to be _Byzantine-fault-tolerant_.
This means that Iroha 2 can tolerate not only peers being inactive on the
network, but also running malicious software and actively trying to falsify
data in the blockchain.

We can mathematically prove that Iroha 2 can work when **up to 33%** of its
nodes are actively trying to stop Iroha 2 from working properly or at all.
In other words, even if someone gained control of a _third_ of all of your
network nodes, an Iroha 2 deployment is _mathematically guaranteed_ to keep
working.

## Minimalist Code Base

Iroha 2 is a minimalist code base. We take great care to vet our
dependencies and avoid large inter-dependent chunks of code.

We provide a few telemetry APIs, including `prometheus` tooling, structured
logging in JSON, as well as compatibility with standard tools used in
Parity Substrate.

Our data is strongly-typed, our methods are statically dispatched. We make
use of the best that Rust has to offer: `serde` and `parity_scale_codec`
for serialisation, `tokio` for co-operative multi-threading, as well as
testing, bench-marking, static analysis and code auditing tools that come
packaged with the exemplary `cargo`.

Our code is easy to reason about, and quick to compile, whilst also being
ergonomic to use and thoughtfully crafted. We have no `panics` and no
`unsafe` code.

## Flexibility

Iroha 2 is also more flexible than the original Iroha due to its modular
design.

It is possible to add or remove features based on a particular use-case. If
you want the blockchain to be extremely fast and work on embedded hardware,
just compile Iroha 2 without the `expensive-metrics` feature. Don't use
telemetry at all? Remove it entirely and enjoy even more performance.
_Permission_ sets are plugins that can be upgraded during run-time.

We have an extensive module system as well as a robust WASM runtime
framework.

## Smart Contracts

Iroha 2 is an event-driven ledger. Each change in the state of the
blockchain is necessarily accompanied by its own event that can _trigger_ a
smart contract: complex logic designed for use in on-chain scripting.

For smart contracts, Iroha 2 supports two approaches:

- [Iroha Special Instructions (ISI)](./advanced/isi.md)
- [Web ASseMbly (WASM)](./advanced/wasm.md)

The first approach is useful when you want very simple transparent logic
and also want to minimise the footprint in the blockchain. All interactions
with the _World state_, that is, the state of the blockchain at this point
in time, has to be done using the aforementioned instructions. There is
also rudimentary support for domain-specific conditional logic.

If you want to learn more about smart contracts in Iroha 2, please consult
our
[Wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/iroha/Scripting+Languages+and+Runtimes+for+Iroha2+Smart+Contracts).

<!-- Long-term deployment of Iroha 2 networks was something that we considered very early in its development. There are **Iroha Special instructions**, that enact upgrades of the network into a consistent state. Iroha nodes can operate if other nodes in the network run different versions of the Iroha 2 binary. -->

## Static and Dynamic Linking

Iroha 2 smartly chooses when to use dynamic linking. This strikes a balance
between it being easy to patch a Critical security vulnerability in a
vendored library like OpenSSL, but also remaining reproducible and portable
across platforms, architectures, and deployments.

::: info

You get the best of both worlds. Patching a security vulnerability is as
easy as running `sudo apt upgrade`. On the other hand, only
security-critical dependencies are linked dynamically, so it is highly
unlikely that any of the smaller and less important libraries can break
Iroha after an upgrade.

:::

## Testing

Iroha 2 is extensively tested. Despite being in active development, Iroha
has 80% line coverage. Keep in mind that line coverage includes
documentation comments, some of which are also tests.

::: info

<!-- Check: a reference about future releases or work in progress -->

There are plans to include Fuzz testing, property-based testing, and
failure-point testing to ensure that Iroha is reliable.
