# Iroha on bare metal

What we are going to do is replicate the setup that we have in
`docker compose` and run Iroha directly, without going through the
intermediary of containers. Running Iroha on bare metal involves
manipulating files and/or environment variables.

The file-based approach is the easiest to get right. Using environment
variables can offer a better user experience if done right, but is more
error-prone, particularly for exotic systems (Windows).

::: info

For this chapter, we assume you have learned about
[configuration](/guide/configure/sample-configuration.md) and
[management](/guide/configure/peer-management.md) in Iroha 2. Here we offer
you instructions to run Iroha on bare metal without going into details
about various configuration options available.

You can always check
[sample configuration files](/guide/configure/sample-configuration.md) for
`configs/peer/genesis.json` and `configs/peer/config.json`, or refer to
[peer configuration options](/guide/configure/peer-configuration.md) for
more details.

<!-- TODO: Add the new configuration reference, once its ready. Issue: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/issues/392
The full list of available options is in the [Iroha Configuration Reference](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/blob/iroha2-dev/docs/source/references/config.md). -->

:::

## Prerequisites

First of all, we should note that we have only built the Iroha client so
far in this tutorial. We also need to build the peer software to run Iroha
on bare metal.

::: info

Building in `debug` mode retains much more information and optimises the
binary to a far lesser extent. As such, we advise you to build Iroha in
`debug` mode for testing: it’s faster and it makes it easier for you to
find issues and fix them. However, if you intend to actually deploy Iroha,
you should build it in `--release` mode.

:::

- To build the peer software in `debug` mode, run:

  ```kotlin
  cargo build -p iroha
  ```

- To build the peer software in `release` mode, run:

  ```kotlin
  cargo build --bin iroha --release
  ```

  The `release` mode binary takes significantly longer to compile than
  `debug` mode, but the result is a smaller and faster binary, suitable for
  deployment in the actual blockchains.

## Setup

### Setup: Environment variables

We want to make sure that we have the right configuration.

There are different ways to do this. You can copy the contents of the
`~/hyperledger/iroha/configs/peer/` into a new directory, or, alternatively, just
run all commands from that directory:

```bash
$ cd ~/hyperledger/iroha/configs/peer
```

The third option is to specify the full path to the configuration file in
an environment variable. For simplicity, we shall do the latter:

```bash
$ cd ~
$ export IROHA2_GENESIS_PATH="$(pwd)/Git/iroha/configs/peer/genesis.json"
$ export IROHA2_CONFIG_PATH="$(pwd)/Git/iroha/configs/peer/config.json"
```

For extra convenience, you could add the Iroha 2 `target` directory to your
`PATH`. This means that instead of having to specify the full path to the
executable `iroha`, you can instead type `iroha` directly into your command
line.

```bash
$ export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/Git/iroha/target/debug"
```

::: tip

Don’t forget to replace `debug` with `release` when you’re ready to deploy
in the real world.

:::

This way you can run `iroha` from any directory without having to worry
about configuration paths and/or specifying the full path to the Iroha
executable.

It is a good idea to make these instructions permanent, which you can do by
adding the environment variables to your startup shell.

::: details Save the instructions to the startup shell

On older Linux systems, you copy and paste the instructions (without the
`cd ~`) to `~/.bashrc`. On Mac OS X 10.6 and later, as well as some Linux
systems, you want to add the same lines to `~/.zshrc`.

Copy these instructions to the specified files (replace `debug` with
`release` when you are ready to deploy):

```bash
$ export IROHA2_GENESIS_PATH="$(pwd)/Git/iroha/configs/peer/genesis.json"
$ export IROHA2_CONFIG_PATH="$(pwd)/Git/iroha/configs/peer/config.json"
$ export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)/Git/iroha/target/debug"
```

:::

::: tip

This process is almost universally unreliable and messy, and it is likely
that your system is special in that it breaks some of our assumptions.

If the above optional steps didn’t work for you, you can keep working in
the `~/hyperledger/iroha/configs/peer/` folder, and run Iroha via
`~/hyperledger/iroha/target/debug/iroha`.

This makes the command-line a little harder to read, which is why we
recommend setting up your environment first.

:::

::: info Note

The tutorial assumes that you’re running either Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows
using WSL. It should be possible to run directly on Windows, but that is
neither recommended nor easy. If you don’t want to use a Unix-like system,
we suggest that you wait until we publish a detailed guide for Windows
users.

:::

### Setup: Files

This is the recommended method of bringing up an Iroha peer. What we do is:

1. Create a new directory for the configuration files:

   ```bash
   $ mkdir -p ~/hyperledger/iroha/deploy
   ```

2. Copy the `peer` configuration into it:

   ```bash
   $ cp -vfr ~/hyperledger/iroha/configs/peer/*.json ~/hyperledger/iroha/deploy
   ```

3. Copy the respective Iroha binary into your binary folder:

   ```bash
   $ sudo cp -vfr ~/hyperledger/iroha/target/debug/iroha /usr/bin/
   ```

   which will install Iroha 2 system wide.

::: tip

You could also use the iroha peer binary locally by copying it into the
same folder. The only difference would be that you’d be calling Iroha like
so: `./iroha` instead of `iroha`.

:::

## First run of Iroha on bare metal

If you’ve done everything correctly, you can now do

```bash
$ iroha
```

to start your first peer and be greeted with

<!-- FIXME untitled -->

![Untitled](/img/appendix_running-iroha_cli-output.png)

This means that everything is working, but also that we need to do some
more work.

You have just started a single peer, which can tolerate exactly 0 faults.
Running two peers is also possible, but again, can tolerate 0 faults. You
must run at least 4 peers in order to have the capacity to tolerate at
least one fault.

In general, if you want to be resistant to `f` faults, you want to have
`3f+1` peers: (`4`, `7`, `10`, etc.).

You cannot really start the peers in any way you want, though. When we
started our original peer, in its configuration, we specified that it has
to trust very specific peers, which have the given private key and listen
on a specific address. In order to know how to run them appropriately, take
a look at `docker-compose.yml`:

:::

For every peer, the `environment` section is a set of things that you
should put in front of the `iroha` command, replacing colons with equals
signs. All the socket addresses are also given internal to the docker
network, so we should replace them with `[localhost](http://localhost)`,
which is `127.0.0.1` on most machines.

::: tip

Each Iroha instance is going to listen on three ports: the Peer-to-peer
communications channel (`133X`), the API url, where most client requests
are posted (`808X`), and finally, a telemetry endpoint `818X`. All three
ports need to be adjusted so there are no collisions. See the
`docker-compose.yml` for an example, and adjust as needed.

:::

## Deploy a minimal BFT network

Both of there approaches are messy and error-prone, which is why the
tutorial uses `docker-compose`. However, this brings you closer to the
experience of actually maintaining a functional Iroha peer.

### Using Environment Variables

To run the First peer, we need to write

```bash
$ TORII_P2P_ADDR="127.0.0.1:1337"
$ TORII_API_URL="127.0.0.1:8080"
$ TORII_STATUS_URL="127.0.0.1:8180"
$ IROHA_PUBLIC_KEY="ed01207233bfc89dcbd68c19fde6ce6158225298ec1131b6a130d1aeb454c1ab5183c0" IROHA_PRIVATE_KEY='{"digest_function": "ed25519", "payload": "9ac47abf59b356e0bd7dcbbbb4dec080e302156a48ca907e47cb6aea1d32719e7233bfc89dcbd68c19fde6ce6158225298ec1131b6a130d1aeb454c1ab5183c0"}'
$ iroha --submit
```

and three other similar lines of bash code for the remaining deployments.

::: tip

To copy and paste into the terminal on Linux systems, you should remember
that `Control + Shift + V` is the appropriate `paste` shortcut.

:::

Also note that we asked this peer to `--submit` or `--submit-genesis`. This
means that in the initial network topology, this peer is the
[leader](/reference/glossary.md#leader). At least one peer (usually the first)
needs to be the leader in the initial topology.

Now you should do the same for the other four peers. Be mindful not to mix
up which address goes where, replace `irohaX` with `127.0.0.1` in the
addresses, and make sure that they correspond to the right public key.

### Using Files

Our first peer can run off of the original configuration file. What we
should do is create three more similar files and move them to three
different folders e.g. `peer1`, `peer2`.

What you need to do is change the `TORII:P2P_ADDR`, `TORII:API_URL`
`TORII:STATUS_URL` and the `PUBLIC_KEY` configuration options to align with
their `docker-compose.yml` counterparts.

Be mindful not to mix up which address goes where, replace `irohaX` with
`127.0.0.1` in the addresses, and make sure that they correspond to the
right public key.

Then, in each of the new folders (with the exception of `peer0`) run:

```bash
$ iroha
```

In the first folder `peer0` you should run:

```bash
$ iroha --submit-genesis
```

We effectively asked this peer to `--submit` or `--submit-genesis` in the
initial, or _bootstrap_, network. This means that in the initial network
topology, this peer is the [leader](/reference/glossary.md#leader).

::: info Note

Only the leader of the genesis network needs to have access to
`configs/peer/genesis.json`. Having the same genesis in the initial folders
of the other peers could be useful, since future versions of `iroha` will
also sanity-check the genesis blocks.

<!-- Check: a reference about future releases or work in progress -->

:::

If all went well, you should be greeted with nice logs on each of the
nodes, and the nodes should commit the blocks to the `blocks/` directory.

## Real-world deployment

Suppose now, that you have done all of the tinkering and want to deploy
Iroha in the real world.

1.  Build Iroha in release mode:

    ```bash
    $ cargo build --release
    ```

2.  Generate a key pair for your peer and take note of that key:

    ```bash
    $ cargo run --bin iroha_crypto_cli
    ```

3.  Register your peer to a network, and make sure to add at least four of
    the peers on that network to the
    [`TRUSTED_PEERS`](/guide/configure/peer-configuration.md#trusted-peers)
    array in your configuration file.

4.  Determine the web socket that the other peers will use to connect to
    you. Make sure that the port is open and use that address
    ([`P2P_ADDR`](/guide/configure/peer-configuration.md#p2p-addr)) in your
    `configs/peer/config.json` file.

5.  After you have finished editing the configuration file, deploy Iroha by
    running

    ```bash
    $ ~/hyperledger/iroha/target/release/iroha
    ```

::: info Note

There is no need to pass the `--submit` flag unless you are starting the
initial peer on the network.
