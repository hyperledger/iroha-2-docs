# Keys for Network Deployment

If you're deploying your own Iroha 2 network, your unique cryptographic keys must be specified in all configuration files:

1. Client configuration file: [`defaults/client.toml`](./client-configuration.md)
2. Genesis block file: [`defaults/genesis.json`](./genesis.md)

To learn more about cryptographic keys and their role, see [Security > Public Key Cryptography](../security/public-key-cryptography.md).

## Setting Keys For a New Network

### 1. Generate New Key Pairs

To generate new key pairs for the peers, a wide variety of methods can be used. However, within the Iroha 2 framework, you can conveniently use the built-in `kagami` tool for generating cryptographic keys.

To generate a new key pair run the following command from the project's `root` directory:

```bash
$ cargo run --bin kagami --release -- crypto --json
```

::: tip Note

The output cryptographic keys generated by `kagami` are customizable by using preferences. Note that in the example above the `--json` parameter is specified to generate a key pair in the JSON format.

To learn more about generating cryptographic keys with `kagami`, available algorithms, and other parameters, see [Generating Cryptographic Keys with Kagami](/guide/security/generating-cryptographic-keys.md#kagami).

:::

If you plan to use the generated `private_key` with one of our SDKs, note that even though cryptographic keys are commonly encoded using ASCII characters, both the `payload` value of the `private_key` and the string representation of the `public_key` are encoded as Hex.

### 2. Update Keys For Peers

If you want to set up your own network, you should change the keys for all your peers: in `peer/config.json` change `PUBLIC_KEY` and `PRIVATE_KEY` to the fresh pair. When you've done that, you should add the keys to the `TRUSTED_PEERS` array in the same configuration file. Every peer that wants to connect to the given peer from the outside must know its `PRIVATE_KEY` specified in the `TRUSTED_PEERS` section.

To create a minimum [BFT](/reference/glossary.md#byzantine-fault-tolerance-bft) network one needs four peers, which means four different private keys split across four different configuration files (or environment variables).

Each peer must have their own `PUBLIC_KEY` and `PRIVATE_KEY` variables specified. All four of the public keys—including the peer that is being configured—must be added to the `TRUSTED_PEERS` array. The same `TRUSTED_PEERS` array must be copied across all four of the configuration files. If either one of the peers is missing, or there's an extraneous peer or one of the peers has the incorrect key, the network will fail to start.

After that, make sure that the peers agree on the `GENESIS_ACCOUNT` key pairs. Failure to do so will result in a network which cannot accept any transactions.

::: tip Note

Even though the private key for the genesis account is known to all peers, the account itself loses all privileges after the first block is committed.

## 3. Register a Non-Genesis Account

Finally, while the first client _could_ use the genesis account to register new users, it's not a great idea for most networks. You should, instead, register a non-genesis account (for example, `alice@wonderland`).

::: warning

`iroha` binary currently processes all of its instructions in the JSON format, it also provides a dedicated instruction to unregister accounts.

If you plan on creating a private blockchain, you should consider writing your own client based on the `client` Rust crate, or any of the provided client libraries:
