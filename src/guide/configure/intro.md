# Iroha Configuration and Management

In this section we explain Iroha 2 configuration files in greater detail:
the [peer configuration](./peer-configuration.md) and
[genesis block](./genesis.md) files needed to start a network, and the
[client configuration](./client-configuration.md) file needed to interact
with the blockchain.

Read about the difference in underlying [types for configuration options](./configuration-types.md).
Check [sample config files](./sample-configuration.md) for the examples of each configuration.

Once you have an Iroha network configured, learn how to
[register and unregister peers](register-unregister.md).

This section also covers how to configure and use [keys](./keys.md) within
Iroha 2.
