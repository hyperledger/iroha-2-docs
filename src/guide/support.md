# Receive support

From time to time, you may have questions about Iroha that you would like
to discuss in detail with others. There are three ways to quickly get in
touch with our community: Telegram, Discord, and GitHub.

A large part of the community currently uses
[Telegram](https://t.me/hyperledgeriroha) for communication. The
Hyperledger part of the team prefers
[Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperledger), with two dedicated channels:
`iroha` and `iroha-2-contributors`. The Discord and Telegram channels are
synchronized, so users of both media see your messages.

Finally, you can
[create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/new/choose),
whether it's a request to update documentation, a suggestion for the core
team, or a bug you have found.
