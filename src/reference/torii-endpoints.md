# Torii Endpoints

::: tip About Parity SCALE Codec

Messages for certain `TORII` operations are encoded with the Parity <abbr title="Simple Concatenated Aggregate Little-Endian">SCALE</abbr> Codec (`SCALE`) commonly used with the [Parity Substrate](https://www.parity.io/technologies/substrate/) blockchain framework, and other blockchains utilizing it.

For more information on `SCALE`, see the [Substrate Documentation: Type encoding (SCALE)](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/) article and its [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/paritytech/parity-scale-codec).

<!-- TODO: link to our own article about SCALE, once it is written; Issue: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/issues/367 -->

Torii (Japanese: 鳥居 — Shinto shrine gateway) is the Iroha 2 module in charge of handling `HTTP` and `WebSocket` requests. It is the main <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr> for interacting with Iroha 2. Such interactions include sending transactions, making queries, listening for blocks stream, etc.

<!-- TODO: Update the following as part of PR #397: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/pull/397

To establish two-way communication with the `TORII` endpoints, the following addresses must be specified in the Iroha 2 configuration files:

1. In the `configs/client_cli/config.json` client configuration file:
   - `TORII_API_URL` — connects to the `TORII` module responsible for handling incoming and outgoing connections.\
   This address is the same as the `API_URL` address in the `configs/peer/config.json` peer configuration file.
   - `TORII_TELEMETRY_URL` — connects to the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoint address that is used as a [metrics](../guide/advanced/metrics.md) tool to monitor the network performance.

   ::: info

   :::

2. In the `configs/peer/config.json` peer configuration file:
   - `API_URL` — connects to the `TORII` module responsible for handling incoming and outgoing connections.\
   This address is the same as the `TORII_API_URL` address in the `configs/client_cli/config.json` client configuration file.
   - `TELEMETRY_URL` — connects to the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) endpoint address that is used as a [metrics](../guide/advanced/metrics.md) tool to monitor the network performance.

## API Version

::: info

This operation requires the specific Iroha node being requested to be compiled with the `telemetry` feature enabled.

<!-- TODO: Link to a topic about Iroha features/flags; Issue: https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/issues/465 -->

:::

- **Protocol**: `HTTP`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Encoding**: `JSON`
- **Endpoint**: `/api_version`

#### Requests

A `GET` request to the endpoint.

#### Responses

| Code | Response | Description                                                                                 |
| :--: | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK       | Returns the current version of the API used by the requested Iroha 2 node as a JSON string. |

**Example**:

```json
"1"
```

::: info

The API version is retrieved from and is the same as the version of the [genesis block](../guide/configure/genesis.md), which means that at least a minimal subnet of four peers must be running, and the genesis block must already be submitted at the time of the request.

:::

## Blocks Stream

- **Protocols**: `HTTP` upgraded to `WebSocket`
- **Encoding**: `SCALE`
- **Endpoint**: `/block/stream`

#### Handshake

Since the `/block/stream` endpoint handles continuous two-way data exchange, a `WebSocket` handshake between the client and server must first be performed to initiate communication with this endpoint.

#### Data Exchange

After establishing a `WebSocket` connection, the client must send a [`BlockSubscriptionRequest`](/reference/data-model-schema#blocksubscriptionrequest) request with the starting block number provided (i.e., the `height` value). Then, upon sending the confirmation and [`BlockMessage`](/reference/data-model-schema#blockmessage) messages, the server starts streaming all of the blocks, beginning with the block specified with `height` up to the most recent one, and then continues to stream new blocks as they are added to the blockchain.

## Configuration / Retrieve

- **Protocol**: `HTTP`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Encoding**: `JSON`
- **Endpoint**: `/configuration`

#### Requests

A `GET` request to the endpoint.

#### Responses

| Code | Response | Description                                                               |
| :--: | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | OK       | Returns a subset of configuration parameters serialized into JSON format. |

**Example**:

```json
{
  "logger": {
    "level": "TRACE"
  }
}
```

::: info

The subset of configuration parameters returned by this operation is equal to the one accepted by the [Configuration / Update](#configuration-update) operation, i.e., it only contains the `logger.level` parameter as of now.

:::

## Configuration / Update

- **Protocol**: `HTTP`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Encoding**: `JSON`
- **Endpoint**: `/configuration`

#### Requests

This endpoint expects a subset of configuration parameters serialized into JSON format. Currently, it only supports dynamic updating of the `logger.level` parameter.

::: info

The list of all accepted values is currently unavailable and will be a part of the configuration reference that is still <abbr title="Work in Progress">WIP</abbr>.

Until then, to get assistance with the acceptable values and their definitions, consult [Receive Support](/help/) for ways to contact us.

The progress on the configuration reference can be tracked in the following GitHub issue:\
[iroha-2-docs > Issue #392: Tracking issue for Configuration Reference as per RFC](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha-2-docs/issues/392).

:::

**Example**:

```json
{
  "logger": {
    "level": "DEBUG"
  }
}
```

#### Responses

| Code | Response | Description                                                                     |
| :--: | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 202  | Accepted | The request to update the configuration is accepted and is due to be processed. |

::: tip Guarantees

A successful configuration update does not guarantee that the configuration is indeed updated. While a follow-up [Configuration / Retrieve](#configuration-retrieve) request will return updated values, the actual update is performed asynchronously.

:::

## Events

- **Protocols**: `HTTP` upgraded to `WebSocket`
- **Encoding**: `SCALE`
- **Endpoint**: `/events`

### Transaction Events

The status of a transaction event can be one of the following:

- `Validating` — The transaction has been successfully submitted and is currently being validated by peers.
- `Committed` — The transaction has been successfully validated and is committed to the blockchain.
- `Rejected` — The transaction has been rejected by at least one peer and is __not__ committed to the blockchain.

All transactions are designated with the `Validating` status upon creation, which later proceeds to either `Committed` or `Rejected`. However, due to the distributed nature of the network, some peers might receive events out of order (e.g., `Committed` before `Validating`).

Some peers in the network may be offline for the validation round. If a client connects to them while they are offline, the peers might not respond with the `Validating` status. But when the offline peers come back online they will automatically synchronize the blocks. These peers are then guaranteed to respond with either `Committed` or `Rejected` status, depending on the information found in the block.

#### Handshake

Since the `/events` endpoint handles continuous two-way data exchange, a `WebSocket` handshake between the client and server must first be performed to initiate communication with this endpoint.

#### Data Exchange

After establishing a `WebSocket` connection, the client must send an [`EventSubscriptionRequest`](/reference/data-model-schema#eventsubscriptionrequest) request, after which the server sends an [`EventMessage`](/reference/data-model-schema#eventmessage) response.

## Health

- **Protocol**: `HTTP`
- **Method**: `GET`
- **Encoding**: `JSON`
- **Endpoint**: `/health`

#### Requests

#### Responses

| Code | Response      | Description                                                    |
| :--: | ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 200  | Health Status | Returns the current status of the peer submitting the request. |

**Example**:

```json
"Healthy"
```

    /// Number of the transactions in the queue
    queue_size: u64,
}

struct Uptime {
    secs: u64,
    nanos: u32
}

::: details Examples

The following examples represent the same data:

::: code-group

  "peers": 4,
  "blocks": 5,
  "txs_accepted": 31,
  "txs_rejected": 3,

  "queue_size": 18
}
```

```[SCALE]

```

:::

::: warning JSON Precision Lost

Almost all fields in the `Status` structure are 64-bit integers, and they are encoded in JSON as-is. Since native JSON's number type according to the specification effectively is `f64`, the precision might be lost on deserialization, for example, in [JavaScript's `JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse).

For more details, see the related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/issues/3964).

:::

::: tip Compact Form in SCALE

Fields with `u64` type are serialized in the [Compact form](https://docs.substrate.io/reference/scale-codec/#fn-1).

:::

### Sub-routing

It is also possible to retrieve the data of a specific `struct` group or variable within it by adding their path to the endpoint address. The sub-routed values are only returned in the JSON format.

**Examples**:

::: code-group
