This way, if you lose your data or something goes wrong, you can quickly get everything back on track. Keep these backups in a different secure place from where you usually keep your data.</li></ul></li></ol><h2 id="security-principles-for-individual-users" tabindex="-1">Security Principles for Individual Users <a class="header-anchor" href="#security-principles-for-individual-users" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Security Principles for Individual Users&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>Adopt robust authentication rules:</p><ul><li><p>Utilise strong and unique passwords for all accounts.</p></li><li><p>Never reuse passwords.</p></li><li><p>Set up <abbr title="Two-Factor Authentication">2FA</abbr> whenever possible. <abbr title="Two-Factor Authentication">2FA</abbr> improves the overall security by not only requiring a password, but also an additional factor such as an <abbr title="One-Time Password">OTP</abbr>, fingerprint, or a third-party app-based authentication (e.g., Google Authenticator).</p></li><li><p>Avoid using SMS authentication as the second factor. There is no guarantee that malicious software is not monitoring all of your SMS messages. For example, Android applications cannot be limited to only accessing the messages intended specifically for them.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Exercise caution in digital communication:</p><ul><li><p>Set up an email client to sign and verify signatures of all the received emails. While it is possible to impersonate the sender&#39;s address and even pose as a bank, it is not possible to fake a signature.</p></li><li><p>Disable both HTML messages and loading of external resources from unknown or unverified addresses.</p></li><li><p>Learn about common phishing techniques to recognise and avoid suspicious emails, links, and requests for personal information.</p></li><li><p>Set up an email client to sign and verify signatures of all the received emails.
