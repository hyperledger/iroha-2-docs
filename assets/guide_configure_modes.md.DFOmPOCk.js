To understand why, let&#39;s talk about permission first.</p><p>By default, Iroha allows <strong>all</strong> instructions to go through, until a permission validator that can restrict instruction execution has been registered. You can add permission validators to your genesis block by registering built-in <a href="/iroha-2-docs/blockchain/permissions.html">permission tokens</a> that we thought would be useful for <code>private</code> and <code>public</code> blockchain use-cases. However, in that case, the process of registering accounts is different.</p><p>When it comes to registering accounts, public and private blockchain have the following differences:</p><ul><li><p>In a <em>public</em> blockchain, anyone should be able to register an account<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>. So, in theory, all that you need is a suitable client, a way to generate a private key of a suitable type (<code>ED25519</code>), and that&#39;s it.</p></li><li><p>In a <em>private</em> blockchain, you can have <em>any</em> process for setting up an account: it could be that the registering instruction has to be submitted by a specific account, or by a smart contract that asks for other details. It could be that in a private blockchain registering new accounts is only possible on specific dates, or limited by a non-mintable (finite) token.</p></li><li><p>In a <em>typical</em> private blockchain, i.e. a blockchain without any unique processes for registering accounts, you need an account to register another account.</p></li></ul><p>Built-in permission validators for private blockchains cover the `<em>typical</em> private blockchain use-case.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>As of writing, the set of public blockchain permissions is incomplete, and as such Iroha source code needs to be modified to run it in the <em>public</em> mode.</p></div><p>Refer to the section on <a href="/iroha-2-docs/blockchain/instructions.html#un-register">instructions</a> for more details about <code>Register&lt;Account&gt;</code> instructions.</p><hr class="footnotes-sep"><section class="footnotes"><ol class="footnotes-list"><li id="fn1" class="footnote-item"><p>In fact, once we have finished with our key-centric address scheme for accounts, you don&#39;t register an account as much as claim it. <a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section>',20),n=[s];function c(r,l,d,u,h,p){return t(),o("div",null,n)}const b=e(a,[["render",c]]);export{f as __pageData,b as default};
