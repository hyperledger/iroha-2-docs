It should be of particular interest to those who are already familiar with Iroha but wish to upgrade and start using the newer version.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p><p>Iroha 1 and Iroha 2 are not compatible. Both projects are very different in their approaches and implementations as evident from the comparisons below.</p><p>Among other changes, cryptography and account structures are implemented differently, meaning that users would have to generate new keys and link their new account with the old one through a centralized service, and no data from Iroha 1 would be accessible from Iroha 2.</p></div><h2 id="fault-tolerance" tabindex="-1">Fault Tolerance <a class="header-anchor" href="#fault-tolerance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Fault Tolerance&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Iroha 2 learned a great deal from the development of the original Iroha. Of particular importance is the new and improved Byzantine-fault-tolerant consensus algorithm—<a href="https://github.com/hyperledger/iroha/tree/main/docs/source/iroha_2_whitepaper.md#28-consensus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><em>Sumeragi</em></a>—that allowed us to expand what could be done on a blockchain without any security risks.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Iroha 1 uses a consensus algorithm called <em>Yac</em>. <em>Yac</em> is <em>crash-fault-tolerant</em>, which means that it can survive a set number of nodes crashing, i.e., losing power, being cut off from the network, or being destroyed with a sledgehammer.</p><p><em>Sumeragi</em>, by contrast, was designed to be <em>Byzantine-fault-tolerant</em>. This means that Iroha 2 can tolerate not only peers being inactive on the network, but also running malicious software and actively trying to falsify data in the blockchain.</p><p>We can mathematically prove that Iroha 2 can work when <strong>up to 33%</strong> of its nodes are actively trying to stop Iroha 2 from working properly or at all. In other words, even if someone gained control of a <em>third</em> of all of your network nodes, an Iroha 2 deployment is <em>mathematically guaranteed</em> to keep working.</p></div><h2 id="minimalist-code-base" tabindex="-1">Minimalist Code Base <a class="header-anchor" href="#minimalist-code-base" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Minimalist Code Base&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Iroha 2 utilizes a minimalist code base. We take great care to vet our dependencies and avoid large interdependent chunks of code.</p><p>We provide a few telemetry APIs, including <code>prometheus</code> tooling, structured logging in JSON, as well as compatibility with standard tools used in Parity Substrate.</p><p>Our data is strongly-typed, our methods are statically dispatched. We make use of the best that Rust has to offer: <code>serde</code> and <code>parity_scale_codec</code> for serialisation, <code>tokio</code> for co-operative multi-threading, as well as testing, bench-marking, static analysis and code auditing tools that come packaged with the exemplary <code>cargo</code>.</p><p>Our code is easy to reason about, and quick to compile, whilst also being ergonomic to use and thoughtfully crafted. We have no <code>panics</code> and no <code>unsafe</code> code.</p><h2 id="flexibility" tabindex="-1">Flexibility <a class="header-anchor" href="#flexibility" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Flexibility&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Iroha 2 is also more flexible than the original Iroha due to its modular design.</p><p>It is possible to add or remove features based on a particular use-case. If you want the blockchain to be extremely fast and work on embedded hardware, just compile Iroha 2 without the expensive <code>metrics</code> feature. Don&#39;t use telemetry at all? Remove it entirely and enjoy even more performance. <em>Permission</em> sets are plugins that can be upgraded during run-time.</p><p>We have an extensive module system as well as a robust WASM runtime framework.</p><h2 id="smart-contracts" tabindex="-1">Smart Contracts <a class="header-anchor" href="#smart-contracts" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Smart Contracts&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Iroha 2 is an event-driven ledger. Each change in the state of the blockchain is necessarily accompanied by its own event that can <em>trigger</em> a smart contract: complex logic designed for use in on-chain scripting.</p><p>For smart contracts, Iroha 2 supports two approaches:</p><ul><li><a href="/iroha-2-docs/blockchain/instructions.html">Iroha Special Instructions (ISI)</a></li><li><a href="/iroha-2-docs/blockchain/wasm.html">Web ASseMbly (WASM)</a></li></ul><p>The first approach is useful when you want very simple transparent logic and also want to minimize the footprint in the blockchain. All interactions with the <em>World state</em>, that is, the state of the blockchain at any given point in time, has to be done using the aforementioned instructions. There is also rudimentary support for domain-specific conditional logic.</p><p>If you want to learn more about smart contracts in Iroha 2, please consult our <a href="https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/iroha/Scripting+Languages+and+Runtimes+for+Iroha2+Smart+Contracts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Wiki</a>.</p><h2 id="static-and-dynamic-linking" tabindex="-1">Static and Dynamic Linking <a class="header-anchor" href="#static-and-dynamic-linking" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Static and Dynamic Linking&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Iroha 2 smartly chooses when to use dynamic linking. This strikes a balance between it being easy to patch a critical security vulnerability in a vendored library like OpenSSL, but also remaining reproducible and portable across platforms, architectures, and deployments.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>You get the best of both worlds. Patching a security vulnerability is as easy as running <code>sudo apt upgrade</code>. On the other hand, only security-critical dependencies are linked dynamically, so it is highly unlikely that any of the smaller and less important libraries can break Iroha after an upgrade.</p></div><h2 id="testing" tabindex="-1">Testing <a class="header-anchor" href="#testing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Testing&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Iroha 2 is extensively tested. Despite being in active development, Iroha has 80% line coverage. Keep in mind that line coverage includes documentation comments, some of which are also tests.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>There are plans to include Fuzz testing, property-based testing, and failure-point testing to ensure that Iroha is reliable.</p></div>',28),n=[r];function s(l,c,h,d,m,p){return t(),a("div",null,n)}const f=e(i,[["render",s]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
